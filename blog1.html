                <p>In an <a href="#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article',]);"
                        target="_blank">interview</a>, Neil deGrasse Tyson talks about science
                    boosting the economy. He goes on to say, most companies and politicians don’t have thetolerance for
                    the long term view.</p>
                <p>You don’t motivate a group of kids, saying “Who wants to be a mechanical engineer and help improve
                    flight efficiency by 15% compared to the airplane your father flew?”</p>
                <p>But instead, ask “Who wants to be an engineer and help develop airfoils to help fly in the atmosphere
                    of Mars?” With the latter, you get the best students in the class.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Flow is the intersection of what you are good at and what challenges you— where difficulty and
                        competency meet.</p>
                    <p>When your competency exceeds the difficulty of a task, you are bored. And when the difficulty
                        exceeds your competency, you are anxious. That was my problem: I was bored.</p>
                    <p>— Jeff Goins, <a href="#"

                <p>There are times where the day job requires me to do the mundane. That’s fine. We can’t always have
                    constant excitement. It’s called work for a reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>For inspiration, this is one of the reasons that I have side projects. To keep pushing my limits.
                        It allows me to play. To find out how to make user interfaces for VR, tinker with implementing
